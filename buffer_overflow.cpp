This Code Demonstrates The Buffer Overlow Vulnerability in this Authentication application Example.
To log in and get the "Welcome" Message, the user must type the right password 

"somestupidpassword!" - password

The Function compares the password to the supplied string(password) and authenticates the user
if the password is right.

The Exploit is in STRCPY Function. It does not map the size of the character array and hence
lets us overwrite the memory in parts that we were not supposed to write to.
Normally that would cause a Segmentation Fault, But if the Variables are arranged in a specific
order in the Stack,then it causes STRCPY to overwrite them!

Example - To Exploit the Buffer_Overflow_Vulnerability in this code, just pass "y" character 
like 40 or 60 times as the password and it will overwrite the validation variable to help
us authenticate!
so to exploit pass - "yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"

#Sidenote: The number of Y characters we have to use will very dependiing on the memory allocation
so try to pass something like 40 - 60 characters and if you get Segmentation Fault, then reduce
the Number!

Feel Free to Toggle the Debug Variable to true / false to see the variable pointer locations and
values to help you understand whats going on, in the Memory!

+-------------------+--------------------+---+-+
| Array A           | Array B            |xx |c|
+-------------------+--------------------+---+-+

a[0]---------->a[19]

the c is the check variable in the stack which will be overflown if we supply
too much characters in the string as the stack writes from left to right 
the xx represent the extra data that may or may not be present sometimes!
